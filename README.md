# Innovation_sprint_astropy

Innovation sprint where I did as many `astropy` tutorials as I can.

## Example1 - [Convert RGB JPEG image into FITS using](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/generated/examples/io/split-jpeg-to-fits.html#sphx-glr-generated-examples-io-split-jpeg-to-fits-py)
  - [pillow](https://python-pillow.org)  for reading the image
  - `matplotlib.pyplot` to display
  - `astropy.io.fits` to save FITS files
